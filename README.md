# 1. Description

This data analysis is part of the Open Science Project at the Master AIRE in the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity -CRI- https://projects.cri-paris.org/projects/ZiC2QRv7/summary

The main goal of this analysis is to explore peer-learning experience in this "online time", listening to students and researchers.


# 2. Abstract 
This past decade has seen the integration of digital technologies into everyday life, allowing people to acquire information faster and have access to extensive pools of information. During the Covid-19 pandemic, digitally mediated interactions have replaced physical interactions. For instance, classes are now instructed on online platforms, people are working from home, and many are finding social connections through online applications. Even though face-to-face contact at Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) is limited, CRI community members (or CRI people) are still connecting to each other in order to achieve their learning goals using online tools. With this question in mind, we have conducted an inductive research project using a survey to study the relationships that exist in online peer learning connections within the CRI community. The results show how exchanging information, collaborative seminars led by students and cooperative learning are the most important online peer learning methods used through  email, WhatsApp, video conferencing  and LinkedIn. Additionally, there is evidence that the appropriate tools and online peer learning awareness could enhance the interactions between members in terms of facilities, methods and motivations.
